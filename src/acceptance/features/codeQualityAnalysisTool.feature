Feature: View errors created by various "code quality analysis tools" (hereafter referred to as: "tools") in BlueJ
  In order to find possible bugs
  As a user with source code, I want to:
   -invoke tools from the BlueJ interface
   -be shown the description of code quality metrics produced by tools
   -get a report of all code quality metrics produced by a given tool for all the
   	 source files for the current project in my running BlueJ instance on demand.
