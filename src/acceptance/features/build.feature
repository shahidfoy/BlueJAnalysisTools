Feature: Build Product
 As a maintainer, I shouldn't have to manually download dependencies to build the product
 As a maintainer or developer, when I check the project out of the repository, 
 	I want to be able to successfully build with no further downloads.
 As a maintainer, I want to have an automated way to update the project dependencies.
 As a maintainer, I want clear instruction on how to build the product or update its dependencies.
 As an end user, maintainer, developer, or tester, I want to know where to find the product after I build it.
